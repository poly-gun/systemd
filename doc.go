// Package systemd package provides various data structures that marshal and unmarshal systemd-specific INI configuration(s). The systemd package also allows
// for marshalling and unmarshalling into various other types of data formats such as json, yaml, ini, and systemd.
//
// A systemd service file is used to describe how a service (a process or a set of processes) should be started and managed by systemd, the system and service
// manager for Linux operating systems. While systemd units can be of various types, including service, socket, device, mount, automount, swap, target, path,
// timer, slice, and scope units, the specific requirements can vary based on the type of unit. However, I'll focus on the typical and most commonly used unit
// type: the service unit file.
//
// In practice, while you can technically create a service with even less information (you could skip the [Install] section if you never want the service to
// start automatically at boot), it's recommended to at least specify these basic sections and fields to ensure clarity, functionality, and integration with
// the system's boot process. Additional fields and sections can be added based on the specific needs and dependencies of your service.
